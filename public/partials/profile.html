        <p>My favorite thing in the world is being outside and enjoying what Mother Nature has to offer! I enjoy swimming and going to the beach. I also love sitting somewhere quiet outside and reading a good book. I have always enjoyed spending time outside. It is fun being able to explore new places! Feel free to check out my profile and see what parks I have visited! </p>
