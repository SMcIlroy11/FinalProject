      <!-- user about me and information follows after -->
        <p class="aboutUser">My favorite thing in the world is being outside and enjoying what Mother Nature has to offer! I love sitting somewhere quiet outside and reading a good book. I have a huge passion for photography as well. I find that the best pictures I have taken are ones that feature nature. It is fun to be able to travel and find cool parks to go to! Ever since I was a little girl, I have enjoyed exploring and visiting. National Parks are great places to explore. It is fun being able to explore new places.</p>
